Hi there! Iâ€™m Gustavo

<!---links--->

I'm a [filmmaker](https://vimeo.com/704772213) and a hobbyist programmer. Create things that me or anyone else can enjoy is my passion and that applies for filmmaking and programming.

I started with VBA for Excel while trying to automatize time consuming tasks and that led me to Python. My next motivation is making my own portfolio website.

- ðŸ‘€ Interested in Javascript, Python and C++
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently having fun with circuit boards (ESP32s, Raspberry Pico and Arduino)
- I'm going through the FullStack JavaScript course from @TheOdinProject using my Raspberry Pi 4 as my web server

Learning algorithms is a great way to find new solutions to my everyday problems.
