Hi there! Iâ€™m Gustavo

<!---links--->

I'm a filmmaker and a hobbyist programmer. Create stuff that someone can enjoy, even myself, is my passion and that applies for filmmaking and programming.

I started with VBA for Excel while trying to automatize time consuming tasks and that led me to Python. My next motivation is making my own portfolio website.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, JavaScript, and C++
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently having fun with circuit boards (Arduino & Raspberry Pi Pico)
- I'm going through the fundamentals course of @TheOdinProject using my Raspberry Pi 4

Learning algorithms is a great way to find new solutions to my everyday problems.
